    ~ What is LEM?

      LEM is my graduate work. I've uploaded it to github
      in the hope that it will be useful to someone. I've
      written all code by myself, but I was using results
      of following open source projects: BCWipe, bleachbit,
      scrub, shred, secure_delete and wipe. I would like to
      express my gratitude and appreciation to their authors!
      All icons were downloaded from the Internet. They are
      free for non-commercial use, but if you are an author
      of one of them and you don't want to see it in my
      project then I will remove it completely.

    ~ Is it ready?

      The code is ready, but there might be some bugs :)
      Translation to english and russian is ready, but
      documentation is still in my dreams... New features
      are not planned, but you can motivate me by $ :)

    ~ How can I install LEM?

      If you trust me (you'd better don't) then you can
      download and install my packages:
      - Arch Linux: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/...
      - Debian/Ubuntu: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/...
      - Mandriva: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/...

      If you don't (good choice) then you need to setup
      your GNU/Linux distribution for creating packages.
      Ask Google how to do it! Here are installing steps.

      At first you need to clone my repository:
      $ git clone https://github.com/AtmashkinMI/LEM.git

      Further depends on your GNU/Linux distribution:
      - Arch Linux:
      $ cd LEM/arch
      $ makepkg -s -i --holdver

      - Debian/Ubuntu:
      $ mv LEM lem-0.11.11
      $ tar czf lem_0.11.11.orig.tar.gz lem-0.11.11
      $ cd lem-0.11.11/debian
      $ debuild -uc -us
      $ cd ../..
      $ sudo apt-get install lem
      
      - Mandriva:
      $ mv LEM lem-0.11.11
      $ tar czf lem-0.11.11.tar.gz lem-0.11.11
      $ mv lem-0.11.11.tar.gz ~/rpm/SOURCES/
      $ cp lem-0.11.11/mandriva/lem.spec ~/rpm/SPECS/
      $ cd ~/rpm/SPECS
      $ rpmbuild -ba lem.spec
      $ cd ~/rpm/RPMS/i586
      $ sudo urpmi --no-suggests lem-0.11.11-1-mdv2011.0.i586.rpm

      - Other:
      $ cd LEM
      $ qmake
      $ make
      $ sudo make install

    ~ How can I configure LEM's appearance in my gtk-based desktop?

      Just look at the directory: /usr/share/LEM/gtk. You can change
      font name, gtk theme and icon theme through its files.

    ~ How can I help?

      You can add translations to other languages, new
      *.xml profiles for applications, packages for your
      GNU/Linux distribution or you can find bugs in
      existing code. Please contact me via email.
